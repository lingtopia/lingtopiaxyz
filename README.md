# Lingtopia Language Guidelines

## Core Principles

Lingtopia is designed as a universal auxiliary language with the following core principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Easy to learn with minimal exceptions and regular patterns
2. **Gender-neutral**: One pronoun for all third-person references
3. **Roman alphabet**: Utilizes familiar Latin script for accessibility
4. **Phonological clarity**: Each sound has a consistent spelling
5. **Functional vocabulary**: Focus on high-frequency, practical words first
6. **Consistent grammar**: Regular patterns without exceptions
7. **Global recognizability**: Roots draw from widely recognized languages

## Word Formation Rules

### Pronouns
- **First person**: Based on 'mi' (I/me)
- **Second person**: Based on 'tu' (you)
- **Third person**: Gender-neutral 'li' (he/she/it)
- **Plurals**: Add 's' (mos, lis)
- **Object forms**: Add 'm' (mim, tum, lim)
- **Possessives**: Add 'n' (min, tun, lin)

### Verbs
- **Base forms**: Simple, often 1-2 syllables (es, ir, ven)
- **Person agreement**: Combine base + pronoun marker for some forms (esmi, esli)
- **Tense markers**: To be added consistently

### Nouns
- **Simplification**: Shortened from recognizable roots
- **Plurals**: Add 's' to the singular form (libro â†’ libros)

### Question Words
- **K-pattern**: Question words begin with 'k' (ke, ki, kom, kuan)

### Articles & Determiners
- **Definite**: 'la' (the)
- **Indefinite**: 'un' (a/an)
- **Demonstratives**: 'dis/das' (this/that) with plurals 'diss/dass'

### Word Sources
- **Romance languages**: Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese
- **Broadly recognized international vocabulary**
- **Latin roots**: For scientific and abstract concepts
- **Simplified spelling**: Remove difficult consonant clusters

## Semantic Categories

Words are organized into semantic domains for easier learning:

1. **Person**: Humans, relations, identities
2. **Nature**: Natural elements, phenomena
3. **Communication**: Speech, writing, expression
4. **Cognition**: Thinking, knowing, understanding
5. **Movement**: Motion, direction, travel
6. **Possession**: Having, owning, belonging
7. **State**: Being, existing, remaining
8. **Action**: Doing, performing, acting
9. **Emotion**: Feeling, reacting
10. **Time**: Temporal concepts, sequencing
11. **Space**: Location, position, arrangement
12. **Quantity**: Numbers, amounts, measurements
13. **Volition**: Wanting, intending, deciding
14. **Social**: Relationships, community, interaction
15. **Abstract**: Concepts, ideas, notions

## Future Development Guidelines

When expanding Lingtopia's vocabulary:

1. **Prioritize frequency**: Add common words first
2. **Maintain consistency**: Follow established patterns
3. **Seek simplicity**: Choose shorter over longer forms
4. **Avoid ambiguity**: Each word should have clear boundaries
5. **Test pronounceability**: Words should be easy to say
6. **Consider internationality**: Draw from widely recognized roots
7. **Preserve regularity**: Minimize exceptions to rules
8. **Balance precision with brevity**: Words should be just long enough to be distinct

## Grammar Structure

1. **Word order**: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
2. **Adjective placement**: Before nouns (like English)
3. **Adverb placement**: Typically after verbs
4. **Prepositions**: Precede their objects (like English)
5. **Questions**: Formed by word order or question words, not by inversion

## Examples of Lingtopia in Use

## Word Creation Process

When adding new words to Lingtopia:

1. Check if a similar concept already exists
2. Identify the semantic category
3. Find recognizable international roots
4. Simplify to 1-3 syllables when possible
5. Ensure pronunciation is straightforward
6. Apply consistent affixes if deriving from existing words
7. Test the word in sample sentences
8. Add to the appropriate category in the word bank
